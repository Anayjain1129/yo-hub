## 29th July: Sch & PCB 
>So, like I'm making this Usb-hub cause I just clicked that I have only 3 ports in my laptop, and two of em' are type-A and 1 is Type-C, And I have recently got my hackpad kit and built it and then I noticed that I don't have fucking ports in my laptop and now i'm just Sobbing. So, it's almost ending of highway but yea here it comes.
>Frist, Really thanks for the guide on jams.hackclub.com It really helped me through out the process.
>So, first I figured out how many ports do i need and all the other bare bone things, I asked hackclubbers and and they were really helpful.
>I don't know how to explain things in the written form but first I did the SCH and imported the libraries and yea it was really a headache.
>I'm adding the screenshots which i took during the process.
